1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
A ull dynamic e-commerce website where users can buy products, and vendors can sell them. 
I have tried to make it look like a real professional website (like Amazon/Flipkart).

Key Highlights:
- The Cart and Wishlist work without reloading the page (I used AJAX for this).
- Admin Panel to manage everything (Users, Products, Reports).
- Vendor Panel for sellers to manage their own products.
- Mobile responsive design using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

2. LOGIN DETAILS (FOR TESTING)
I have created a demo Admin account for you to check the backend features:

Admin Login:
- Email: admin@gmail.com
- Password: password123

(You can also create a new Customer or Vendor account from the Signup page).

3. NOTE
I have focused on making the UI clean and the code secure (used prepared statements). 

Thank You.
